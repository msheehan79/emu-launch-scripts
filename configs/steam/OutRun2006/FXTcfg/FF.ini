[General]
Enable=0
*Which device is the wheel, set to 0 for off
JoystickID=1 

*What effect file to load.  You can make your own if you wish but it's hard!
Effect=OR2Wheel

*Used to tweak the overall strength of effects... 0 to 1 for 0% to 100%... WARNING!  Will be applied to EVERYTHING!
GlobalMultiplier=1

*the total number of variables in the tweak (can be any length).. variables will be used to store and manipulate values pulled from effects that can be applied to tweaks.
NumVars=2



*-----------------------------------------------------
*For each effect you have the following options:

*Multiplier - Essentially the strength of the effect
*VarNum - which variable to apply the effect to,  0 to apply it to none
*Operator - What to do to the effect, potential options are "=" "+" "-" "*" "/" and "OR"
*typically if you are wanting to add a bunch of effects to the same variable, you use "OR" which averages them out. 
*(This is how the 360 gamepads are done... multiple effects ORed to the two motors)

[Tweaks]
*These work exactly like tweak files in mamehooker, only instead of using a bunch of mamehooker specific flags, you use the variable numbers you defined above
(%1% through your max val)
NumTweaks=7
Tweak1=1|Gain|%1%
Tweak2=2|Gain|%2%
*Tweaks 3-7 are the spring settings, you can change them here if you wish.
Tweak3=3|XPositiveSaturation|0
Tweak4=3|XNegativeSaturation|0
Tweak5=3|XNegativeCoefficient|500
Tweak6=3|XPositiveCoefficient|500
Tweak7=3|XOffset|0
